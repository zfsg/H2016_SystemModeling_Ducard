# What is this?

This git repository represents part of a collection of summaries of varying quality and extent.
It was created with the motivation to establish en effective basis for sharing knowledge and profiting from each others work. It allows using a common, working latex base by design.
The collection comprises summaries in german, in english, sometimes including a short version (which is usually more up to date than the long one - guess why...).


# Git workflow for ZFSG

0. If you're new to git read an [introduction](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

1. Contact [me](mailto:muellegi@student.ethz.ch) to get access to one of the [available summaries](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles/blob/master/ListOfSummaries.md).

2. Choose a local folder to contain your summaries.

3. `cd` to `chosen folder` and clone the [Headerfiles](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles) repo:

    `git clone https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles`

4. Git will have created a `Headerfiles` folder in your `chosen folder`. Clone your chosen summary into that same `chosen folder`. 

    `git clone https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/SummaryName`

5. Create your own branch, do your adaptation, push when you're finished or to back up.

6. Contact [me](mailto:muellegi@student.ethz.ch) if you need help with git or latex or life in general.
